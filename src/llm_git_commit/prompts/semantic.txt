Write a semantic commit message in the format: type(scope): description

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore
Scope: the affected component/module in parentheses (optional but preferred)
Description: imperative mood, under 50 characters total for the first line

Examples:
- feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
- fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint
- refactor(db): simplify query builder interface

Return ONLY the commit message, nothing else.
